# Next Big Steps for Health Tracker Project

## 1. Deployment & Dependencies
**Big Goal:** Make the project easy to install, run, and maintain for anyone.

### Steps:
1. Create a requirements.txt
2. Add installation instructions to README
3. (Optional) Add a setup.py or pyproject.toml
4. (Optional) Add version management

## 2. Performance Optimizations
**Big Goal:** Make the app more efficient and robust for long-term use.

### Steps:
1. Database Connection Pooling
2. Frame Buffering for Video
3. Optimize Database Queries
4. Add Caching for Frequently Accessed Data

## 3. Memory Leaks & Resource Management
**Big Goal:** Ensure the app doesn't leak memory or leave resources open.

### Steps:
1. Audit QImage/QPixmap usage
2. Camera Resource Management
3. Frame Buffer Management

## 4. Hardcoded Values & Magic Numbers
**Big Goal:** Make the app configurable and easier to maintain.

### Steps:
1. Move hardcoded values to a config file or settings table
2. Document all configuration options

## 5. ML Model Improvements
**Big Goal:** Make fatigue prediction and anomaly detection more robust.

### Steps:
1. Review and document current thresholds
2. Add feature engineering/normalization
3. Improve model evaluation
4. (Optional) Allow user feedback to improve model

## 6. User Feedback & Error Handling
**Big Goal:** Make the app user-friendly and robust to errors.

### Steps:
1. Add user feedback for missing features/dependencies
2. Improve error dialogs

## 7. Documentation & Onboarding
**Big Goal:** Make it easy for new contributors and users to get started.

### Steps:
1. Expand README with troubleshooting and FAQ
2. Add docstrings to all major functions/classes
3. Document the data schema and config options

## 8. (Optional) Refactoring & Architecture
**Big Goal:** Make the codebase more maintainable.

### Steps:
1. Gradually refactor duplicate code into shared modules
2. Consider dependency injection for easier testing
3. Add more unit tests as you refactor

# Recommended Next Steps (Iteration 1)

1. Create a requirements.txt and test a clean install
2. Move all hardcoded values to a config/settings file
3. Add user feedback for missing dependencies (MediaPipe, camera)
4. Audit and fix any obvious memory leaks in video/posture code
5. Document the data schema and config options
